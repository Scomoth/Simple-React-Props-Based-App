## Knowledge to work on project
Javascript, React fundamentals are must to work on this project. Webpack fundamentals can be ignored for now as I had developed this webpage utilizing Scrimba Platform. Try utilizing this code on Scrimba Platform. The only difference from normal webpack projects is to replace 'index.js' with 'index.pack.js' in 'index.html' file. Only then will the code get executed in Scrimba Platform which has already been done in code. I would recommend utilizing create-react-app module to create React Webpages initially. Webpack utilization is a bit more advanced.
